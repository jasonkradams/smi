## When Emojis May Be Acceptable

In rare cases, minimal emoji use is acceptable for:
- **Status indicators**: ✅ ❌ ⚠️ (sparingly)
- **Lists comparing approaches**: ✅ GOOD / ❌ BAD patterns

Even in these cases, prefer text alternatives like "GOOD:", "BAD:", "NOTE:", "WARNING:".

## Rationale

- **Accessibility**: Screen readers may not convey emoji meaning clearly
- **Professionalism**: Technical documentation should maintain formal tone
- **Longevity**: Emoji trends change; text remains clear
- **Clarity**: Plain text is universally understood
