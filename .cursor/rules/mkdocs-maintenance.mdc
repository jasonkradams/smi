# MkDocs Documentation Maintenance

When adding, moving, or removing documentation files, always maintain the MkDocs configuration and verify the build.

## Required Steps

### 1. Update mkdocs.yml

After adding or modifying documentation files, update `mkdocs.yml` to include the new content in the navigation structure:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Section:
    - New Article: section/new-article.md
```

### 2. Run mkdocs build

Always run `mkdocs build` after documentation changes:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

### 3. Resolve All Issues

Fix **all** issues reported by mkdocs build, including:

- **ERROR**: Must be fixed (broken links, missing files)
- **WARNING**: Must be fixed (invalid config, deprecated syntax)
- **INFO**: Must be resolved (missing nav entries, unreferenced files)

## Common Issues

### Missing Nav Configuration

```
INFO - Doc file 'articles/new-article.md' is not included in the 'nav' configuration.
```

**Fix**: Add the file to the `nav` section in mkdocs.yml

### Broken Links

```
WARNING - Doc file 'guide.md' contains a link to 'missing.md' which does not exist.
```

**Fix**: Correct the link or create the missing file

### Duplicate Paths

```
WARNING - A 'nav' item 'Guide' defined in the config contains a path '...' that is already used by another item.
```

**Fix**: Remove duplicate entries or use unique paths

## Checklist

When adding documentation:

- [ ] New .md file created in appropriate docs/ subdirectory
- [ ] mkdocs.yml updated with nav entry
- [ ] `mkdocs build` executed successfully
- [ ] All ERROR, WARNING, and INFO messages resolved
- [ ] Build output shows "Documentation built successfully"
