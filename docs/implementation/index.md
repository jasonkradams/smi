# Implementation Details

This section contains detailed technical documentation about the implementation of major features and systems in the Spokane Mountaineers Salesforce org.

## Available Implementation Guides

- **[Custom Login Page Implementation](custom-login-page-implementation.md)** – Complete technical documentation for the custom Experience Cloud authentication flow, including login and forgot password pages, username normalization, custom labels, and testing strategy.

1. **Knowledge Transfer** – Provide detailed context for future developers and maintainers
