# User Sync: Salesforce to Google Workspace

This automation ensures that only **active** members of the Spokane Mountaineers have user accounts in **Google Workspace**, and that:

- All active users are placed in the **`IdP Users Only`** organizational unit (OU)
- Inactive users are **suspended or removed** from Google Workspace

## Overview

The architecture relies on Salesforce Flows and Google Apps Script, requiring no external server or infrastructure.

## Components

### Salesforce Org
- **Scheduled Flow:** Queries all members where `User.IsActive == "True"`
- **Named Credential:** Configured to securely send data to a Google Apps Script endpoint via HTTP

### Google Workspace
- **Google Apps Script Web App:** Receives a list of active members and compares it to the users in the `IdP Users Only` OU
- **Google Workspace Admin SDK:** Used by the script to create, update, suspend, or delete user accounts

## Sync Behavior
| Case                                                  | Action                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| User is Active in Salesforce but not in Google        | **Create** Workspace account |
| User is Active in both                                | **NoOp**                |
| User is not Active in Salesforce but exists in Google | **Delete** account           |
