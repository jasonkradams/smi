## üìÜ Schedule

- **Runs Daily** at **04:30 AM UTC** (9:30 PM Pacific the previous evening)
- Type: **Scheduled Flow**
- Trigger: **Platform-Scheduled**, not user-initiated

---

## üéØ Purpose

This Flow:

- Adds eligible users (active site users) to a specific Chatter Group (CollaborationGroup).
- Skips users who are already members of the group.
- Logs each operation (whether added or skipped) into the `Conservation_Group_Membership_Log__c` object.

---

## üìã Criteria for Eligible Users

The flow targets **active Community users**, defined as:

```plaintext
User.IsActive = true
AND (
  User.UserType = 'Customer Portal User' OR
  User.UserType = 'PowerCustomerSuccess' OR
  User.UserType = 'PowerPartner'
)
```

These users are queried via a Get Records element labeled **Get_User_Records**.

----

## üß± Flow Structure
### 1. Get Existing Group Memberships
* Retrieves all CollaborationGroupMember records for the **Conservation Group**.
* Group ID is hardcoded as: 0F91N000000m2jESAQ.

‚†Ä2. Get Active Community Users
* Loads active site users matching the criteria above.

‚†Ä3. Loop Through Each User
* For each user:
  * Filters existing memberships to check if the user is already in the group.
  * Uses a Decision node (Member in Group?) to branch:

---

## ü§ñ Decision Logic
### ‚ùå If the user is not already a group member:
* Assigns:
  * CollaborationGroupId = 0F91N000000m2jESAQ
  * MemberId = User.Id
  * CollaborationRole = Standard
* Adds the new member record to a collection for batch creation.
* Logs the action with:
  * Message__c = "Added To Conservation Group"

‚†Ä‚úÖ If the user is already a member:
* Loops through their existing CollaborationGroupMember record(s)
* Logs the status:
  * Message__c = "Already a Member"

---

## üì¶ Record Creation
At the end of all processing:
* The flow **bulk-creates** all new CollaborationGroupMember records.
* It also **bulk-creates** all Conservation_Group_Membership_Log__c log entries.

## üõ† Key Variables and Resources
|          **Variable Name**           |                      **Type**                      |               **Description**               |
| :----------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
| variable_collaboration_group_members |       Collection of CollaborationGroupMember       |      Holds new group members to create      |
|   variable_conservation_group_logs   | Collection of Conservation_Group_Membership_Log__c | Holds logs for both added and skipped users |
| variable_collaboration_group_member  |          Single CollaborationGroupMember           |        Template record used per user        |
|      variable_conservation_log       |    Single Conservation_Group_Membership_Log__c     |      Template log record used per user      |

---

## üßæ Logging Details
Each log record stores:
* User_ID__c
* Username__c
* Email__c
* Group_Member_Id__c
* Role__c
* Updated_At__c (timestamp)
* Message__c: either "Added To Conservation Group" or "Already a Member"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases Handled
* Users not in the group are added and logged.
* Users already in the group are skipped and logged.
* The Chatter Group ID is hardcoded to prevent accidental misrouting.
* Only users who are **eligible site users** are processed.

---

## üìà Monitoring & Auditing
Admins can monitor execution by:
* Querying the Conservation_Group_Membership_Log__c object
* Filtering by Updated_At__c or Message__c
* Verifying membership through CollaborationGroupMember records
