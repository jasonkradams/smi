# Delete Federation ID From Users

This document explains the **Delete Federation ID From 25 Users** flow used for mass resetting user Federation IDs.

This flow was critical when reconfiguring the Federation ID generation logic across all users, and was used to **bulk clear existing Federation IDs** before rebuilding them properly.

## 📋 Purpose

- Quickly **clear (null out)** the `FederationId` field for active User records.
- Remove incorrect or duplicate Federation IDs when the original creation formula was found to be flawed.
- Ensure that all Users could be assigned **new, correct Federation IDs** afterward.

---

## 🔎 How It Works

1. **Pull Users Without Federation ID**:
   - Get up to 25 Users at a time who still have a populated FederationId.
   - Filters out integration users, inactive users, and others not needing modification.

2. **Decision: Records Present?**:
   - If users are found → Continue.
   - If no users are found → Create a single Log entry and End.

3. **For Each User**:
   - **Create a Log Record** capturing the removal action.
   - **Assign an empty value to FederationId** (effectively nulling it).
   - Add the User and Log Record to their respective Collections.

4. **After Loop**:
   - **Update User Records** in bulk (nulling Federation IDs).
   - **Create Log Records** in bulk for auditing.

5. **End**.

## 🛠 Manual Running

- This flow was **manually triggered** multiple times (about 60 clicks).
- Each run cleared Federation IDs for up to 25 users.
- Repeatedly running the flow cleared **all users** in manageable, batch-safe steps.

> 🛠 **Note**: This method is "quick and dirty" — not perfect — but effective for a one-time reset.

## 🔍 Associated Logs

Logs are created under the custom app:

- **App Name**: `Remove Federation ID Logs`
- Accessible via the App Launcher by searching for `Remove Federation ID Logs`.
- These records contain:
  - Which User was cleared.
  - When the clearing action happened.
  - Original Federation ID values.

✅ These logs provide full auditability of all Federation ID resets performed.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Always ensure Federation ID formulas are stable before mass applying them.
- Having a quick "clear/reset" tool ready can save significant time during cleanup efforts.
- Batching 25 records at a time avoids DML governor limits and memory overages.
