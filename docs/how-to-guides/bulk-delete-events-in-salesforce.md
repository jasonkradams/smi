# How To: Bulk Delete Events in Salesforce

When a user accidentally creates a large number of recurring Events (e.g., hundreds of records), manually deleting them one by one is not practical. This guide shows how to identify and bulk delete Events safely using Salesforce tools.

## Delete Events Using Developer Console (SOQL Query)

1. **Open the Developer Console**
    - In Salesforce, click the **⚙️ (Setup gear)** in the top right.
    - Select **Developer Console**.

3. **Run a SOQL Query to Identify Records**
    - Example query:
        ```sql
        SELECT Id, Subject, ActivityDate, CreatedById
        FROM Event
        WHERE Subject LIKE '%%Bad Event Subject%%'
        ```
    - Replacing `%%Bad Event Subject%%` with the actual subject or criteria of the unwanted Events.
    - Add filters such as `Subject LIKE '%Meeting%'` or `ActivityDate >= 2025-09-01` to narrow results.

4. **Review the Results**
    - Confirm you’re only pulling the unwanted Events.
    - Export results if you want a record for audit.

5. **Delete the Records**
    - Copy the list of Ids and use **Data Loader** or **Workbench (see below)** to bulk delete.
    - Alternatively, use **Execute Anonymous** with Apex (advanced).

1. **Open the Developer Console**
    - In Salesforce, click the **⚙️ (Setup gear)** in the top right.
    - Select **Developer Console**.
